# Torrent-Scraper
A Python-based chatbot that allows users to search for TV series torrents by season and episode. It integrates the TV Maze API to fetch show metadata and dynamically scrapes torrent sites to retrieve magnet links, seeders, and lechers. Includes caching with disk cache, reducing repeated search times from 30â€“60 seconds to under 0.2 seconds.
